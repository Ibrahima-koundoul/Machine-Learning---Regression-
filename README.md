# Machine-Learning---Regression-
This directory contains the different linear regression models that I implemented in python on data with linear and non-linear relations, using these tools: Sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot. There you will find a set of methods and tools from the simplest to the most optimal to obtain an effective model.
